There has been an extensive literature on how foreign direct investment (FDI) diffuses spatially as a result of the creation of vertical and horizontal supply chains in the economics literature. These studies have effectively illustrated the need to account for spatial interdependencies. Missing from their analysis, however, are any discussions of the political barriers that may serve as impediments to FDI Flows. We argue that misconfigured political institutions can act as firewalls to the spatial diffusion of FDI. Our hypothesis is that both spatial diffusion of FDI and the political configurations in target countries are important but they are also dependent upon one another, if a country is to successfully attract FDI. To test this we employ a novel network based approach using bilateral FDI flow data.

<!-- There is an extensive literature in Economics on the spatial diffusion of FDI. But instead of physical space, we think that political space is also important, given the existing works in political science which show that beyond economic factors, institutions matter in investorsâ€™ decision as well. -->

<!-- (Maybe) Spatial diffusion is particularly important for institutions, because having experience in the region / similar countries this is how investors learn to adapt to institutions, especially informal rules. -->
